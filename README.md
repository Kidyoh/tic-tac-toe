This project was done while learning react for the first time, this is my first project. 

A fun way to learn React for those who are still in the beginning stages! Used the documentation provided by [![React](https://React.dev)

Features:

* Only functional components!
* useEffect, useState hooks instead of state.
* Simple use of `props`.
* Use tailwindCSS component to customize the UI
* Users enter their names, their names will be displayed, green text will be on their profile when its their turn, and Leaderboard updates based on their score.
* Understand how functions can be sent down as `props` and consumed.
* Typescript for static type checking!
